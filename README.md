# SAR-raw-data-simulator
SAR raw data processing simulator based on the book:
DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS IN RADAR IMAGE PROCESSING by Bu-Chin Wang.

*LFM-tests* gives formulas for creating LFM pulsed signal (symmetric and nonsymmetric) and its visualization. This so-called chirp signal is used in SAR radars for illuminating the imaged surface. A number of such chirp signals (pulses) are sent and their backscatter from the surface is recorded.

*SAR-Raw-Data-Simulator* simulates the signals that would be sent and reflected from a single point target and from multiple (three concrete) point targets. Point targets represent the simplest, ideal, objects that could be recorded.
